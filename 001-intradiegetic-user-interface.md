Years ago, I read a post on [r/outside](https://www.reddit.com/r/outside/) about _user interfaces_ in human experiences.

This concept deeply resonated with me, and my preferences for video game interfaces. Rather than seeing health bars or bullet counters, I prefer a simpler, more realistic approach.
